The latest releases of Percolator, its converters and Elude are available at
the downloads page: https://github.com/percolator/percolator/downloads
There you may find package for Linux and compiled executables for Win32. Source
bundles are available to build from scratch if you are running a different
system or if you do not have superuser privileges.

INSTALLING (from packages or installer)

Download the desired package (referred to as [package] in the instructions 
below) from the downloads page mentioned above:
  ".deb" packages are available for Debian distributions (such as Ubuntu)
  ".rpm" packages are available for Red Hat (such as Fedora).
The converters depend on Percolator itself, which must be installed first!

Ubuntu (11.04)
Issue the following to install the necessary dependencies for Percolator:
  $ sudo apt-get install libxerces-c3.1 libboost-dev libboost1.42-dev gengetopt
and the following for the converters:
  $ sudo apt-get install libtokyocabinet8 libsqlite3-0
Then, in the directory where the package has been downloaded:
  $ sudo dpkg --install [package].deb
Note that the converters depend on Percolator, which must be installed first!

Fedora (13)
Issue the following in the directory where the package has been downloaded:
  $ wget ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/fedora/development/rawhide/x86_64/os/Packages\
    /xerces-c-3.1.1-1.fc16.x86_64.rpm
  $ sudo rpm -ivh xerces-c-3.1.1-1.fc16.x86_64.rpm
  $ sudo rpm -ivh [package].rpm

Linux (other distributions)
For other distributions you might have to manually build and install some of
the following libraries:
  libxerces-c3.1.so
  libstdc++.so.6
  libtokyocabinet.so.8
  libsqlite3-devel.so

Windows
The Percolator and Elude installers have been tested on Windows XP SP2, Windows
Vista and Window 7. Download the Windows installer, double click and follow the
installation procedure. Once completed, open a DOS prompt and invoke Percolator
from the directory where it was installed.

BUILDING (from source bundle or the repository)

*** READ THIS CAREFULLY: you MUST install the required libraries! ***
The following instructions are for Ubuntu (versions 10.04, 10.10 and 11.04).
Make, Cmake and a C++ compiler are required. To build Percolator, the following
libraries are also needed: libxerces-c-dev, libboost-dev, libsqlite3-dev. 
To build the converters: libxerces-c-dev, libboost-dev, gengetopt,
libtokyocabinet-dev, zlib1g-dev. In addition, both need Code Synthesis XSD in
it 3.3 version. All the above is automatically installed by following the steps
below; if you do note have superuser privileges, you will have to manually
install the mentioned libraries. The same goes for older versions of Ubuntu and
other operating systems (as explained above under "INSTALLING").
The following instructions are written for Percolator, but the same procedure
applies for both the converters and Elude. The converters depend on Percolator
itself, which must be installed first!
Download the latest [tar-ball].tar.gz and decompress it; we will refer to the 
generated directory as "/path/to/source" (that would be the src/converters 
subdirectory for the converters, and src/elude in case of Elude).
You can now install all the required libraries mentioned above with the command:
  $ cd /path/to/source;
  $ ./install/get_packages_ubuntu.sh
The script will terminate by printing a string to cout; we will refer to that
string as "/prefix/path".
We will now proceed to build percolator in /tmp, but any directory where the
user has read/write privileges can be chosen. Issue the following:
  $ mkdir /tmp/percolatorBuild; cd /tmp/percolatorBuild
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/prefix/path" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/tmp" \
    [-G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"] [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug"] \
    /path/to/source
  $ make -j8; make install

Advanced users (and developers) may clone the project with Git by issuing:
$ git clone git://github.com/percolator/percolator
This will create a directory called "percolator" that is to be used as
/path/to/source in the instructions above


***


TESTING

In order to be able to properly execute the tests, the following are require:
  python 2.6 interpreter
  xmllint.
Those are not stated among the requirements in "BUILDING" since a working
version of the software can be compiled without them. The following
instructions are written for Percolator, but the same procedure applies for
both the converters and Elude.
Assuming Percolator has been installed as explained above, it can be
automatically tested by issuing:
  $ cd /tmp/percolatorBuild
  $ make test
If errors are encountered, the directory /tmp/percolatorBuild/Testing/ will
contain log files that can be used to debug the problem.
