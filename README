The latest releases of Percolator, its converters and Elude are available at
the downloads page: https://github.com/percolator/percolator/downloads
There you may find package for Linux and compiled executables for Win32. Source
bundles are available to build from scratch if you are running a different
system or if you do not have superuser privileges.

INSTALLING (from packages or installer)

Download the desired package (referred to as [package] in the instructions 
below) from the downloads page mentioned above:
  ".deb" packages are available for Debian distributions (such as Ubuntu)
  ".rpm" packages are available for Red Hat (such as Fedora).
  ".dmg" packages are available for Mac.
  ".exe" windows installers.
The converters depend on Percolator itself, which must be installed first!

Ubuntu (11.04)
Issue the following to install the necessary dependencies for Percolator:

  $ sudo apt-get install libxerces-c3.1 xsdcxx libboost-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-system-dev

the following for the converters:

  $ sudo apt-get install  libsqlite3-0  libleveldb-dev leveldb-doc zlib1g-dev 
or
  $ sudo apt-get install  libsqlite3-0  zlib1g-dev libtokyocabinet8
or
  $ sudo apt-get install  libsqlite3-0  zlib1g-dev libboost-serialization-dev

the following for Elude:

  $ sudo apt-get install libboost-dev

*** The tool converters can be compiled using three different data engines [boost-serialization, tokycabinet or leveldb]. 
*** This can be indicated by setting one of these compilation flags to ON : -DBOOSTDB or -DTOKYODB -DLEVELDB=ON
*** Originally by default the boost-serialization version is taken.

NOTE that the packages Xercesc-c and Xsd codesynthesis might have to be installed manually depending on which
platform/repository percolator is building on. In that case follow the links below :

http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/
http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/

Then, in the directory where the package has been downloaded:
  $ sudo dpkg --install [package].deb
Note that the converters depend on Percolator, which must be installed first!

Fedora (15)
All the external dependencies listed before are available to be downloaded and installed in the yum repository in Fedora.
Then the rpm package can be installed as usual : sudo rpm --install packagename.rpm

Mac OSX
All the external dependencies listed before are available to be downloaded and installed in the curl repository in Mac.
Then the dmg can be installed as usual.

Linux (other distributions)
For other distributions you might have to manually build and install some of
the libraries described before.

Cross-Compilation (MinGW)
Percolator, Converters and Elude are compatible with cross-compilation in Fedora, Ubuntu and Windows
using MinGW. Note that all the dependencies listed before have to be cross-compiled and installed
in the MinGW home folder.
Converters are only able to be cross-compiled using the BOOST xml-serialization scheme. Support
for tokyocabinet and leveldb will soon be added.

Windows
The Percolator, Converters and Elude installers have been tested on Windows XP SP2, Windows
Vista and Window 7. Download the Windows installer, double click it and follow the
installation procedure. Once completed, open a DOS prompt and invoke Percolator
from the directory where it was installed.


PATCHES AND VERSIONED LIBRARIES

A patch to fix a bug in the XSD binaries por MAC is included.
A patch to fix a bug in the MinGW-PortableXDR for Fedora is included.
An implementation of the Windows compatible version of Tokycabinet is 
avaible in the repository ( Note that it is still in development process)
An implementation of LevelDB compatible with different platforms is avaible
to download in the repository.

BUILDING (from source bundle or the repository)

*** READ THIS CAREFULLY: you MUST install the required libraries! ***
The following instructions are for Ubuntu (versions 10.04, 10.10 and 11.04).
Make, Cmake and a C++ compiler are required. To build Percolator, the following
libraries are also needed: libxerces-c-dev, xsdcxx,  libboost-dev, libboost-filesystem-dev and libboost-system-dev. 
To build the converters: libxerces-c-dev, xsdcxx, libsqlite3-dev, libboost-dev, libboost-filesystem-dev,libboost-system-dev, libboost-serialization-dev or
libleveldb-dev or libtokyocabinet-dev and zlib1g-dev. Note that tokyocabinet and leveldb are both optional libraries
In addition, both need Code Synthesis XSD in
it 3.3 version. All the above is automatically installed by following the steps
below; if you do note have superuser privileges, you will have to manually
install the mentioned libraries. The same goes for older versions of Ubuntu and
other operating systems (as explained above under "INSTALLING").
The following instructions are written for Percolator, but the same procedure
applies for both the converters and Elude. The converters depend on Percolator
itself, which must be installed first!
Download the latest [tar-ball].tar.gz and decompress it; we will refer to the 
generated directory as "/path/to/source" (that would be the src/converters 
subdirectory for the converters, and src/elude in case of Elude).
We will also refer as "/path/to/build" as the build directory.

We will now proceed to build percolator in "/path/to/build", but any directory where the
user has read/write privileges can be chosen. Issue the following:
  $ cd /path/to/build
  $ cmake [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr/local/bin"] \
          [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug" | "Release"] \
          [-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/libraries"]
          /path/to/source
  $ make -j8; make install

NOTE that all the params between [] are just optional

DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX = indicates where to install percolator
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = indicates the type of building (Release by default)
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH = indicates and extra path to look for packages for example the binaries of XSD.

In case percolator needs to be cross-compiled. Issue the following :
  $ cd /path/to/build
  $ cmake [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr/local/bin"] \
          [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug" | "Release"] \
          [-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/libraries"]
          -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"
          -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="/path/to/source/cmake/windows_percolator/Toolchain-mingw32.cmake"
          /path/to/source
  $ make -j8; make install

NOTE that all the params between [] are just optional : 
NOTE that when cross compiling, all the dependencies have to be cross compiled under MinGW and located
in the default MinGW directory.

Advanced users (and developers) may clone the project with Git by issuing:
$ git clone git://github.com/percolator/percolator
This will create a directory called "percolator" that is to be used as
/path/to/source in the instructions above


***


TESTING

In order to be able to properly execute the tests, the following are require:
  python 2.6 interpreter
  xmllint.
Those are not stated among the requirements in "BUILDING" since a working
version of the software can be compiled without them. The following
instructions are written for Percolator, but the same procedure applies for
both the converters and Elude.
Assuming Percolator has been installed as explained above, it can be
automatically tested by issuing:
  $ cd /path/to/build
  $ make test
If errors are encountered, the directory /tmp/percolatorBuild/Testing/ will
contain log files that can be used to debug the problem.
