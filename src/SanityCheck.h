 * SanityCheck sets the initial direction of the SVM, either from an input
 * weight file, a default direction given by the user or in the input file,
 * or the single most discriminative feature, and checks that the trained
 * direction is not worse than the initial one: by the targets with q < test
 * FDR summed over the test bins, each with its own q values, or by those of
 * the merged out-of-fold list, see DirectionCheck and Caller's
 * --direction-check. Where the trained direction is worse, the folds fall
 * back (resetDirection) to the default direction chosen on each fold's
 * training set or, with a weights file, per fold to its weights or that
 * default direction, whichever separates more targets of the training set
 * (see chooseResetVectors), unless --override keeps the trained vectors.
