RAMP is a non-sequential parser for mzXML and mzDATA instance documents.  

This is the more modern version of RAMP that can:
  read the HUPO-PSI mzData XML format
  handle 64bit peaklists
  handle missing or broken mzXML indexes 
it replaces http://sashimi.cvs.sourceforge.net/sashimi/RAMP/

Note that this version of RAMP has a new API, which was needed to add the mzData read capability.  It's a simple change, RAMPFILE instead of FILE, rampOpenFile instead of fopen, etc.

Also found in this directory is the cRAMP C++ wrapper for RAMP.
