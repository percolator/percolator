  scoring PSM for each peptide.

* Bugfix: fixed sqt2pin to accept extra characters in the peptides of the input files.
* Remove some external dependencies and/or libraries.
* Added support to APPLE systems.
* Added support to WINDOWS system through cross-compilation under MINGW.
* Bugfix: Compilation error of sqt2pin in some platforms.
* Removed warnings in the building process.
* Added cross compilation compatibility with Ubuntu-Debian systems (MinGW).
* Improved the building and compilation process.
* Added parameter -M to activate the exp_mass in the ouput of percolator.
* Bugfix: Execution error while creating temporal directories in sqt2pin fixed.
* Created a patch for XSD binaries libraries in MAC.
* Created a patch for XDR serialization in Windows.
* Added an adapted version for percolator of LevelDB and TokyoCabinet libraries.
* Generated packages for MAC,Ubuntu and Fedora systems.
* Generated installer of percolator,elude and sqt2pin for windows systems.
* Added GUI for installers in Windows. Included icons, language options as well as many add-ons.
* Improved the compatibility and robustness of the code.

v2.01
* Bugfix: corrected PSM level statistics for cases when percolator executed w/o -U flag

v2.00
* Added Fido code to infer proteins and calculate protein level assignments (experimental feature)
* Changed the naming scheme for PTMs from *#@ notation to UNIMOD notation. 
* Added a option for Lys-N Processing capability
* Removed bug in sqt2pin that hindered combination of multiple sqt-files using meta-files
* Separation of the code so that we have separate source packages for percolator, its converters, and elude.
* Removed bug in the sqt2pin processing that hindered large file data processing
* Added option in qvality for handling generalized decoys (experimental feature) 

v1.17
* Bugfix for cases where the same peptide occurres both among the target and decoy PSMs

v1.16
* Elude handles both non-modified and posttranslationally modified peptides
* Validation of Percolator's input against local copy of xml schema
* Bugfix for Sqt2pin when invoked with -2 option

v1.15
* New XML input format ("pin") and revised output format ("pout") for percolator.
  Schemas are available in src/xml.
* Unique peptide level q-values are reported alongside PSM level q-values.
* All PSMs from the same fragmentation spectrum end up in the the same cross 
  validation bin
* Output of observed mass for PSMs rather than fragmentation spectrum, to aid
  the processing of FT-ICR data.

v1.14
* Added a weed out redundant PSMs and just keep unique peptides option (-U)
* Trimming the logistic regression conversion chriteria. Also itroduced correct 
weighting during rougness penalty estimation. Both edits will have influence on
  the PEP calculations.
* New sqt format reade for S lines, checking for 9 or 10 fields and if computername set or not
* Added code dealing with in-source CID fragmentation in RT prediction.

v1.13
* Filtering out redundant peptides before retention time regression training
* Bugfix for retention time feature calculation
* Introduced a percolator -r and qvality -o option to redirect stdout to file
  (important in the windows environment).
* Updated percolator xml scheme to include decoy PSMs id -Z switch set

v1.12
* Changed licensing scheme for percolator
* PNGase F feature (option -N) introduced

v1.11
* Bugfix for qvality binning procedure
* Introduced a sqrt(abs(dM)*abs(dRT)) feature for the Description of correct

v1.10
* Changed merging procedure of cross validation sets sio that the
  scores so that the decoy score between the first
  and 10th percentile becomes uniform (rather than first and third
  quantile as previously)
* Added independent train and test set for determining the gamma and C
  parameters in the retention time calculation.
* Corrected a binning procedure bug, who's symptom has been a
  "bad_alloc()" error statement.

v1.09
* Removed bug in the normalization of retention times when using tab
  delimited input.
* Introduced a range limit in the iterative least square procedure used
  in the Posterior Error Probability calculations.
v 1.08
* Retention time and callibration calculations are now available from
  tab delimited files as well.
* Output xml-files according to the definitions in
  http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/percolator/model/percolator_out.xsd

v 1.07
* Command line switch to output decoy scores (-B)
* Switch for replacing retention time features with the Klammer et al. features.

v 1.06
* Retention time calculation
* Added features for differenceto mean - retention time, pI and calibration
* Changed cross validation strategy so that only one target and one decoy set should be given as input.
