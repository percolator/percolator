v3.02
* Changed FDR calculation for initial direction selection to the more liberal decoys/targets (#208)
* Added parameter file option instead of only command line specification (#149)
* Allow training only on best PSM per peak group or spectrum (#207)
* Include spectral counts for lists of protein inferences (#202)
* Allow separate control of FDR threshold for initial iteration (#190)
* Added check of deltaMass and retentionTime columns with DOC features (#167)

v3.01.2
* Fixed empty output on xxx2pin converters on MacOS (#178).

v3.01.1
* Fixed macOS installer problems with macOS 10.11+ (#193)

v3.01
* Changed all FDR calculations to the more conservative: (decoys+1)/targets
* Added `-o`/`-no-terminate` flag to allow overriding of fatal errors:
  * No default direction can be found: set to the first feature (#135)
  * Separation between target and decoy PSMs/proteins is too great: continue with this direction anyway
  * No target PSMs present: return empty result list
  * No decoy PSMs present: give all target PSMs a q-value of 1/numPSMs
  * No features present: create a single pseudo feature which is always zero
  * Too many values in default direction vector: trim default direction vector to number of features
* Added mix-max method for FDR and PEP calculation, which replaces target-decoy competition as the default method. The advantage is that this will report all input PSMs in the PSM output and also corrects for incorrect native spectra in qvality (#152)
* Automatic detection of search input as coming from a concatenated search or from separate target and decoy searches. For a concatenated search, the mix-max method will be skipped. For separate target and decoy searches the user can choose to use the mix-max method (default) or target-decoy competition (-Y flag)
* Updated and improved stderr output to be more informative
* Fixed fasta in-silico digestion for protein grouping which mistook N-methionine cleavage for a non-enzymatic cleavage site (#148)
* Fixed retention time NaN predictions by setting them to 0 instead (#150)
* Fixed protein group representation for picked-protein in the case that protein names contain a comma, by replacing these by semicolons (#153)
* Fixed tandem2pin issue that labeled all PSMs as decoy when providing separate target and decoy input files (#154)
* Added OpenMP runtime library to be included in windows installer (#158)
* Fixed msgf2pin converter issue with C-terminal modifications (#161)
* Fixed tandem2pin to parse PTMs (#132)

* Fixed sqt2pin issue of skipping second modification if there are two consecutive PTMs (#116)
* Added OpenMP support for a maximum of 3 cores (1 for each of the cross validation bins). 
  * runs about 2 times as fast, instead of the theoretical 3 (#119).
  * memory usage is slightly higher (<5%) than the single core implementation, since some structures had to be triplicated
  * the number of cores can be set to 1 dynamically by setting the environment variables
  ```
  export OMP_DYNAMIC=FALSE
  export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
  ```
  
v2.08.01
* Changed behaviour of `-r` and `-B` (=peptide result file names for target and decoy) flags in combination with `-U` (=only PSM statistics) flag. The provided file names will now contain the PSM results, provided that the new `-m` and `-M` (=PSM result file names for target and decoy) flags are not given. This will allow backwards compatibility with percolator 2.04.

v2.08
* Added flags for writing results to explicit filenames instead of using suffixes (#104):
```
-r : target peptide results (is ignored with -U flag)
-m : target PSM results
-l : target protein result (only works with -A flag)

-B : decoy peptide result (is ignored with -U flag)
-M : decoy PSM result
-L : decoy protein result (only works with -A flag)
```
* Restored redundant `-j` flag for tab delimited input for backwards compatibility (i.e. running percolator as `percolator -j tab_output` does not result in errors, but functionally does exactly the same as `percolator tab_output`) (#103)
* Added backwards compatibility with tab delimited input format of percolator before v2.06 by allowing the scan number column to be missing (scan numbers will be assigned automatically). (#102)
* Added more specific error reporting for problems with tab delimited input format. (#95, #96, #97)
* Added default vector for tandem2pin converter (#94)
* Added a fix for the RPM `/usr/bin` permission error in the fedora build script (#90)
* Added a fix for Ubuntu 14.04 problem with XSD package (#100)

v2.07.02
* Fixed wrong xml directory reference in msgf2pin and tandem2pin on windows
* Added warning message to converters if files are not present

* Fixed percolator output with `-r` flag
* Switched to static linking of external libraries

v2.06
* Modified the xxx2pin converters to output tab delimited files 
  by default rather than pin xml-files

        -D (--no-prune-proteins)

	alpha,beta and gamma values for fido.
