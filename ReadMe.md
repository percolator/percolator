This repository holds the source code for percolator and format
converters software packages; a software for postprocessing of shotgun
proteomics data.

The source code is hosted at github, binary downloads can be found in the release repository:
https://github.com/percolator/percolator/releases

The building procedure is cmake-based. Helper scripts for building on
different platforms can be found in: admin/builders/

The cleanest way to build is to use the vagrant virtual machine
system, which can be setup using the script: admin/vagrant/manager.sh
